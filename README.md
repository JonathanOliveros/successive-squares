# successive-squares
## Summary
An algorithm that computes the modulus of a number
## What I Learned
- Reinforced the self taught syntax of python
- How to implement OOP that was originally taught to me in Java
- How to use the matplotlib module
## Results
This is a comparison of the time complexity of my algorithm versus just using
```python
base**exp % mod
```
